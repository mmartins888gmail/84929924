**PLSQL Challenge**

**1.Define primary keys, constraints, and indexes for each table:**

1_Primary_Keys.sql


**2.Suggestion to partition large tables like item_loc_soh to improve query performance:**

2_Partition_Index.sql


**3.To avoid row contention, the suggestion is to optimizing SQL queries, e.g. avoiding bitmap indexed due to its maintaining time**



**4.Create a view that can be used at screen level to show only the required fields**

4_create_view.sql


**5.Create a new table that associates user to existing dept(s)**

5_create_users_table.sql


**6.Create a package with procedure or function that can be invoked by store or all stores to save the item_loc_soh to a new table that will contain the same information plus the stock value per item/loc (unit_cost*stock_on_hand)**

6_package_new_table.sql


**8.Create a package with a pipeline function to be used in the location list of values (drop down)**

8_package_pipelined.sql
